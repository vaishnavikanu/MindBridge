## Diagnostic Criteria
A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day.
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day.
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day.
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt.
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness.
9. Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt.

## CBT for Depression

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for depression. It focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.

### Core Components:
1. **Cognitive Restructuring**: Identifying automatic negative thoughts and challenging cognitive distortions
2. **Behavioral Activation**: Increasing engagement in rewarding activities
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Developing coping strategies for life stressors
4. **Relapse Prevention**: Creating a plan for maintaining gains

### Evidence Base:
Multiple RCTs demonstrate CBT efficacy for mild to moderate depression. Combined with medication for severe cases.

## Anxiety Disorders Overview

### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
Excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities.

### Treatment:
- CBT is first-line psychotherapy
- SSRIs/SNRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy
- Combination therapy for severe cases

I feel worthless and like a burden to my family. Hard to concentrate at work.
I keep thinking about death, not that I'd do anything, but the thoughts are there.
